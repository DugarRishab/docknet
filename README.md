# DockNet

DockNet is a Docker‑powered network emulator that lets you spin up containerized nodes in any topology to prototype, benchmark or stress‑test virtually any distributed­-system algorithm—be it consensus, routing, gossip or custom protocols. With DockNet you get:

* **Flexible Topologies:** Define arbitrary node counts and connectivity patterns via Docker Compose.
* **Pluggable Workloads:** Drop in your own executable or script in each container to run any networked logic.
* **Real‑Time Telemetry:** Stream logs and metrics over WebSockets (or your preferred channel) for live monitoring.
* **Repeatable Experiments:** Version‑controlled configuration files make it easy to rerun tests under identical conditions.

Whether you’re researching Tangle‑style DAGs for energy microgrids or exploring novel peer‑to‑peer protocols, DockNet provides a turnkey, containerized playground for your network simulations.
